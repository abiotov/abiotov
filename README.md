### Why Iâ€™m here
I design, train, and deploy intelligent systems that make it easier for people to **access, process, and use information**. I bridge **research â†” production**: from paper reproduction and fine-tuning to real-time inference on GPUs, with clean APIs and tooling developers actually enjoy using.

> I approach engineering with stoicism: build like a mental model â€” **clean, efficient, resilient**.

---

### What Iâ€™m doing now
- ðŸ”­ Working on advanced **NLP tools**, **agentic workflows**, and **model deployment** pipelines.  
- ðŸŒ± Studying **scalable LLM orchestration**, **AI safety**, and **multi-agent** coordination.  
- ðŸ‘¯ Open to collaborate on **open-source AI infra**, **applied NLP**, and **LLM developer tooling**.  
- ðŸ¤” Seeking input on **fine-tuning optimization** and **efficient inference on limited hardware**.  
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him

### I specialize in
- **Real-time inference on GPU**: from containerized services to autoscaling endpoints.  
- **Fine-tuning & optimization** for domain-specific tasks and measurable outcomes.  
- **Paper-to-production**: reproducing SOTA ideas and hardening them for production.  
- **Technical leadership**: mentoring juniors, code reviews, and raising engineering quality.  
- **AI agents**: prototyping autonomous systems that compound value over time.

---

### Core expertise
- **End-to-end ML pipelines**: data prep â†’ training â†’ evaluation â†’ deployment  
- **Infrastructure-aware development**: GPU, Docker, APIs, CI-ready workflows  
- **LLMs & Agents**: RAG systems, prompt engineering, **fine-tuning**, agentic orchestration

---

### Tech stack
- **Languages**: Python, Bash  
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, LangChain, FastAPI  
- **Tools**: Git, Docker, Linux, Pandas, NumPy, OpenCV, Tesseract, Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Copilot, Notion  
- **Focus Areas**: NLP, autonomous agents, R&D translation, scalable AI systems

---


### How I work (principles)
- **Reliability first**: correctness, observability, and failure modes before features.  
- **Clarity in design**: simple interfaces, sharp boundaries, minimal coupling.  
- **Performance with intent**: profile â†’ prioritize â†’ optimize what matters.  
- **Safety by default**: evals, guardrails, data handling, and responsible release.

---

### Ask me about
**LLMs, embeddings, vector databases, FastAPI, LangChain, PyTorch** â€” happy to pair, review, or brainstorm tough problems.

---

### Letâ€™s build
- Collaborations on **open-source AI infra**, **applied NLP**, and **LLM tooling**  
- Conversations about **efficient inference** and **fine-tuning strategies**
